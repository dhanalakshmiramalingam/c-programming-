Suppose the number to be check is 6: The user has provided one number that is ‘6’, now we have 
to think and calculate by which other numbers we can divide ‘6’ and get the remainder as ‘0’. If the 
remainder is zero, then we can say that ‘6’ is divisible by that number and we can take this number 
into consideration to get the sum by using some more other numbers. Compile and execute the 
above C program.
Sample Input:
Given Number: 6
Sample Output:
Its a Perfect Number 
Test cases:
1. 17
2. 26!
3. 143
4. 84.1
5. -963
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
 int num,rem,sum=0,i;
printf("enter a number\n");
scanf("%d",&num);
for(i=1;i<num;i++)
{
rem=num%i;
if(rem==0)
 {
 sum=sum+i;
 }
}
if(sum==num) 
 printf("%d is a perfect number");
else
 printf("\n%d is not a perfect number");
getch();
}
Testcases:
1. enter a number:17
17 is not a perfect number
2.enter a number:26
26 is a perfect number
3.enter a number:143
 143 is not a perfect number
4.enter a number:84.1
84.1is not a perfect number
5.enter a number:-963
-963 is not a perfect number

2.Compile and Execute the C program to find the Factorial of a positive integer (number) is the sum 
of multiplication of all the integers smaller than that positive integer. N! is denoted as factorial of N. 
For example, factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals to 120.
Sample Input:
N = 5
Sample Output:
120
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int i ,fact=1,number;
printf("enter a number:");
scanf("%d",&number);
for(i=1;i<=number;i++){
fact=fact*i;
}
printf("factorial of %d is:%d",number,fact);
return 0;
}
Testcases:
 1 .enter a number:5
 factorial of 5 is:120
2. enter a number:0
 factorial of 0 is:1
3. enter a number:-5
 factorial of -5 is:1
 
4. enter a number:1
factorial of 1 is:1
